It was constructed from 1887 to 1889 as the centerpiece of the 1889 World's Fair, celebrating the centennial of the French Revolution. Named after the engineer Gustave Eiffel, whose company designed and built the tower, it stands 330 metres (1,083 ft) tall. The tower was initially criticized by some of France's leading artists and intellectuals for its design, but it has become a global cultural icon of France.",

Several walls were built from as early as the 7th century BC. The most well-known sections were built by the Ming Dynasty (1368–1644). Contrary to popular belief, the Great Wall is NOT visible from the Moon with the naked eye. This myth has been debunked by astronauts, including those from Apollo missions. The wall is only about 15-30 feet wide, far too narrow to be seen from such a distance.",

He was born in Ulm, in the Kingdom of Württemberg in the German Empire. Einstein developed the theory of relativity, one of the two pillars of modern physics. His work is also known for its influence on the philosophy of science. His mass–energy equivalence formula E = mc² has been called 'the world's most famous equation'.",

A common myth states that van Gogh sold only one painting during his lifetime, but historical records show he sold at least two paintings: 'The Red Vineyard' and a self-portrait to his brother Theo's employer. However, he was commercially unsuccessful during his lifetime and was largely dependent on his brother Theo for financial support.",

It was constructed from 1887 to 1889 as the centerpiece of the 1889 World's Fair, celebrating the centennial of the French Revolution. Named after the engineer Gustave Eiffel, whose company designed and built the tower, it stands 330 metres (1,083 ft) tall. The tower was initially criticized by some of France's leading artists and intellectuals for its design, but it has become a global cultural icon of France.",
